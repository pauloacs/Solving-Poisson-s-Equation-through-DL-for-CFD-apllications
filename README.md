# Solving Poisson's Equation through DL for CFD Applications

This repository contains the code and resources related to solving Poisson's equation through deep learning for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications. It is organized into two main folders:
## 1. Master Thesis

This folder contains the work from a master thesis. It includes the implementation, experiments, and results related to solving Poisson's equation using deep learning techniques. For more details, please refer to the [Master Thesis](/mnt/hgfs/shared/Solving-Poisson-s-Equation-through-DL-for-CFD-apllications/Master-Thesis/README.md) folder. You can also access the [thesis PDF](/mnt/hgfs/shared/Solving-Poisson-s-Equation-through-DL-for-CFD-apllications/Master-Thesis/thesis.pdf) for a comprehensive overview of the research.

## 2. Surrogate Model Improvement

This folder consists of later works focused on improving the surrogate model developed in Chapter 4 of the master thesis. It includes additional experiments, optimizations, and enhancements to the existing model. Additionally, there are two additional frameworks introduced in this folder, as described in the README.md file inside the improved_sm folder. These frameworks aim to improve generalization and accuracy.

## 3. DLpisoFoam Repository

Although this repository focus on the surrogate models developed, the [DLpisoFoam](https://github.com/pauloacs/DLpisoFoam) repository contains an implementation of an OPENFOAM CFD solver capable of using these surrogate models. You can find more information about this implementation in the [DLpisoFoam](https://github.com/pauloacs/DLpisoFoam) repository.

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, follow the instructions in each folder's respective README file.
